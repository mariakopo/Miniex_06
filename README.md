//Blue Waves

My program is based on different colors and random shapes with a nice sound playing in the background which you can control with your mousepad. Just pressed play and enjoy. 



		
//What are the rules that you have employed in your program?//

When you open the program you see a blue color which only appears when you start the program. 
When you click with your mousepad the color will change and the music will start to play to set the mood. If you click again the music will stop and you will get a random color also in the color of blue. 
 

I have named my program "Blue Waves" because of the blue colors and the music. I got some inspiration form the the song that is named "Blue Whale". 





//By using some of the concepts from the article - Generative Art Theory, can you discuss how is your program expressed the notion of generativity?//
		
From the text by Philip Galanter "Generative Art Theory"  he describes a generative art that uses randomization. The randomization is used in my program for creating different kind of shapes and creating a different color of blue. 
		
Generative art is also constantly changing over time. The randomization of the shapes creates a unpredictability to the program since the shapes are always in motion. 
		
If you look closely you can see that the program is based on a number of small squares which is constantly moving too. At last generative art is created by a running code on the computer which is also the case here.
